This is forked from a Sinatra app which shows how to do Facebook Login/Logout, as well as Like & Share buttons. 

To use this application, you first need to go to Facebook and get application credentials. 

http://www.facebook.com/developers/createapp.php

You need your:
    Facebook application ID: <APP_ID> 
    Facebook application secret:   <APP_SECRET> 

Also, pick a "Application Name"  for your app in the Facebook config page. 
 	
You need to set up Ruby (I used 1.9.2) and the heroku gem
> gem install heroku
	
To deploy this application at heroku.com, you need to do the following:

1. git clone https://jgodse@github.com/jgodse/jgodseFaceboku.git
2. cd jgodseFaceboku
3. heroku create --stack bamboo-ree-1.8.7
4. git push heroku master
5. heroku config:add FB_APPLICATION_ID=<APP_ID> FB_APPLICATION_SECRET=<APP_SECRET>
6. heroku open
7. Go to the application configuration page at Facebook and make sure that the "Site URL" and 
"Canvas URL" is the same as the URL for this app. If you need to rename this app, use a 
"heroku rename" on the app before reconfiguring Facebook. 
8. At this point, reload the URL of your Facebook App and you should be able to login, logout, and hit the "like" and "share buttons. 


* Note that this application does not work on the heroku stack bamboo-mri-1.9.2
* Run "heroku stack" to ensure that it is bamboo-ree-1.8.7
